# 👋 Hi, I'm Kareem Farahat

🎓 **Computer Engineering Graduate** | 🛡️ **Offensive Cybersecurity Engineer** | 🚀 **Founder – Farahat Medical**

I work at the **intersection of building systems and breaking them**.

My focus in offensive security is understanding how attackers think, where assumptions fail, and how small weaknesses turn into real‑world security risks.

I believe cybersecurity is not about tools or checklists.
It’s about **mindset, threat modeling, and challenging what everyone assumes is “secure enough.”**
