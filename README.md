## Hi, I'm Kareem Osama Farahat

Offensive Security Engineer with a Red Team mindset.

I focus on understanding how real attackers think, where system assumptions fail, and how small design flaws escalate into serious security risks.

My approach to cybersecurity is not tool-driven or checklist-based.
I analyze systems from an attacker’s perspective, map trust boundaries, break assumptions, and study real exploitation paths — especially those caused by weak architecture and flawed design decisions.

## What I Work On

- Offensive security & penetration testing
- Red Team thinking and attack simulation
- Threat modeling and assumption analysis
- Exploiting authentication, authorization, and logic flaws
- Studying how secure-looking systems fail in real-world scenarios

---

## How I Approach Security

I don’t start with tools.
I start with questions:

- What does this system assume is “safe”?
- Where is trust implicit instead of enforced?
- What happens if a single component fails?
- How can an attacker chain small weaknesses into full compromise?

I break systems to understand how to build them better.

## Areas of Interest

- Offensive security research
- Red team operations & adversarial thinking
- Secure system architecture
- Backend systems & infrastructure security
- Real-world exploitation techniques

---

## Current Focus

- Building intentionally vulnerable systems to study exploitation paths
- Writing attack-focused security writeups
- Developing small offensive tools for recon and abuse scenarios
- Improving my ability to think and operate like a real attacker
